#  NYC Transit Intelligence Dashboard

A real-time **NYC Transit Dashboard** built with **Python + Dash**, featuring:

- Live DOT traffic highway camera streaming (via **511 NY Government Video Feeds**)
- AI-based traffic simulation generating metrics.csv
- Auto-updating traffic visualization (cars, buses, trucks)
- ETA estimation / Delay prediction / Alternative route recommendations
- NYC Weather + NYTimes RSS News Feed
- Dynamic route selector with PNG maps stored under /assets
- Deployable locally or on **Hugging Face Spaces**

> This repository includes **documentation + dataset + step-by-step instructions**, meeting academic submission requirements.

##  Features

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| Live Camera Player | Streams official **NY 511 DOT cameras (public access)** |
| AI Detection Simulation | Generates `metrics.csv` with vehicle counts (no YOLO required to run) |
| Traffic Graph | Auto-refresh every 5s from CSV |
| ETA Estimation | Basic calculation based on congestion level |
| Delay Prediction | Forecasts bus delay from traffic density |
| Alternative Route Advice | Suggests Q-routes / subway alternatives |
| Weather & News | Queens weather via `wttr.in` & NYTimes RSS |
| Route Maps | Selectable PNG bus maps loaded from `/assets` |
| Careers Ad Rotator | MTA + DOT job feed rotating live |

##  Installation (Local Run)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Auraphaxmeimeimei/AI-Transit-Dashboard.git
cd AI-Transit-Dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Then open:

http://127.0.0.1:7860

Click "Enter Dashboard" to start.

No API keys required.
Camera feed + weather + news will load automatically.

One-Click Deployment on Hugging Face
```
Files required in root:
```
app.py
requirements.txt
assets/ (PNG bus route maps)
```
Ensure app end contains:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(host="0.0.0.0", port=7860, debug=False)
```
Steps:

Create HuggingFace Space → type: Dash

Upload repo or link GitHub

Build will auto-launch

##   Dataset + Codebook

metrics.csv is generated by run_detection_for_dashboard().

Column	Description
ts	Timestamp (ISO format)
cars	Random simulated count (5-30)
buses	Random simulated count (0-3)
trucks	Random simulated count (0-5)

This dataset supports visualization, ETA and delay inference. When YOLO/GTFS sources are integrated, this table can expand with vehicle speed, occupancy, spatial coordinates, or frame counts.


##  Data Sources & API Attribution
Data Source	Usage
NY DOT 511 Cameras	Traffic camera streaming
wttr.in	Real-time weather data
NYTimes RSS	Local region news

Camera feed originates directly from New York State Government open access streaming.
No raw video is redistributed; only links are displayed.

##   Usage Notes

Launch dashboard → choose route/camera

Click Run AI Detection → generates realtime metrics.csv

Graph + ETA + Delay + Route Advice activated automatically

Weather refresh: every 10 min

News refresh: every 8 sec
