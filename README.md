#  NYC Transit Intelligence Dashboard

A real-time **NYC Transit Dashboard** built with **Python + Dash**, featuring:

- Live DOT traffic highway camera streaming (via **511 NY Government Video Feeds**)
- AI-based traffic simulation generating metrics.csv
- Auto-updating traffic visualization (cars, buses, trucks)
- ETA estimation / Delay prediction / Alternative route recommendations
- NYC Weather + NYTimes RSS News Feed
- Dynamic route selector with PNG maps stored under /assets
- Deployable locally or on **Hugging Face Spaces**

> This repository includes **documentation + dataset + step-by-step instructions**, meeting academic submission requirements.
