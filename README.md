#  NYC Transit Intelligence Dashboard

A real-time **NYC Transit Dashboard** built with **Python + Dash**, featuring:

- Live DOT traffic highway camera streaming (via **511 NY Government Video Feeds**)
- AI-based traffic simulation generating metrics.csv
- Auto-updating traffic visualization (cars, buses, trucks)
- ETA estimation / Delay prediction / Alternative route recommendations
- NYC Weather + NYTimes RSS News Feed
- Dynamic route selector with PNG maps stored under /assets
- Deployable locally or on **Hugging Face Spaces**

> This repository includes **documentation + dataset + step-by-step instructions**, meeting academic submission requirements.

##  Features

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| Live Camera Player | Streams official **NY 511 DOT cameras (public access)** |
| AI Detection Simulation | Generates `metrics.csv` with vehicle counts (no YOLO required to run) |
| Traffic Graph | Auto-refresh every 5s from CSV |
| ETA Estimation | Basic calculation based on congestion level |
| Delay Prediction | Forecasts bus delay from traffic density |
| Alternative Route Advice | Suggests Q-routes / subway alternatives |
| Weather & News | Queens weather via `wttr.in` & NYTimes RSS |
| Route Maps | Selectable PNG bus maps loaded from `/assets` |
| Careers Ad Rotator | MTA + DOT job feed rotating live |

##  Installation (Local Run)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Auraphaxmeimeimei/AI-Transit-Dashboard.git
cd AI-Transit-Dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

http://127.0.0.1:7860

Click "Enter Dashboard" to start.

No API keys required.
Camera feed + weather + news will load automatically.

One-Click Deployment on Hugging Face
```
Files required in root:
```
app.py

Optional future folders
| Folder         | Purpose                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `screenshots/` | UI preview for report or submission |
| `data/`        | For real GTFS/traffic datasets      |
| `docs/`        | Extended technical documentation    |

##   Dataset + Codebook

metrics.csv is generated by run_detection_for_dashboard().

| Column   | Type                   | Meaning                              |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ts`     | string (ISO timestamp) | Timestamp of each simulated frame    |
| `cars`   | integer                | Random simulated traffic count（5–30） |
| `buses`  | integer                | Random simulated bus count（0–3）      |
| `trucks` | integer                | Random simulated truck count（0–5）    |


This dataset supports visualization, ETA and delay inference. When YOLO/GTFS sources are integrated, this table can expand with vehicle speed, occupancy, spatial coordinates, or frame counts.
